## üõ†Ô∏è Improvements that can be done with more time

### 1. Application Architecture

- Introduce a global state management tool or use React useContext + useReducer for handling shared data and avoiding prop drilling

### 2. UX Enhancements

- When the user drags across time slots in the Weekly view, a new appointment modal can open pre-filled with the selected time range
- Display validation messages for each form field individually
- Improve mobile layout and interactions (eg: bottom sheet modals, better responsiveness for more mobile screens)
- Make appointments trackable by adding a status field

### 3. Data Model

- We can add explicit `patient_relatives` table to connect `patients` with `relatives` because there is currently no relation between them, which limits features like showing related people during appointment creation
- The current `appointment_assignee` table lets us assign relatives to appointments, but it doesn't enforce any database-level link
  Recommendation: we can enforce foreign key on `appointment_assignee.user` to the proper user type (e.g: relatives/doctors) and normalize users into a shared user table with roles
